## Introduction

The internet is an amazing thing. It connected the world in unimaginable ways. Yet there are core problems that we accept as immutable. 

Routing protocols like BGP can’t route traffic based on real-time information because there isn’t a layer to aggregate and deliver that information. This leaves users at the whims of congestion, outages, and even censorship.

Meanwhile, every packet sent over the public internet is unencrypted by default. We push the responsibility of privacy onto users themselves, layering additional services on top of the internet to compensate for foundational flaws.

Yet what if you could build on an automatically-optimized, encrypted by default internet? What if it was all completely compatible with current internet protocols, paving the way for immediate adoption?

The dawn of the DeWeb movement is upon us. Right now, hundreds of teams, projects, and individuals are working to decentralize the internet at its core. Some are focused on content delivery and storage. Others are revolutionizing how we think of security and performance.

When large numbers of dedicated people work in unison, amazing things happen. It’s time we bring these parties together for a multi-week, hyper-focused effort to accelerate the world’s adoption of DeWeb technologies.

Introducing the 2021 DeWeb Hackathon, presented by [https://www.syntropynet.com/](Syntropy).
