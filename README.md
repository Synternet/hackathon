## Introduction

The internet is an amazing thing. It connected the world in unimaginable ways. Yet there are core problems that we accept as immutable. 

Routing protocols like BGP can’t route traffic based on real-time information because there isn’t a layer to aggregate and deliver that information. This leaves users at the whims of congestion, outages, and even censorship.

Meanwhile, every packet sent over the public internet is unencrypted by default. We push the responsibility of privacy onto users themselves, layering additional services on top of the internet to compensate for foundational flaws.

Yet what if you could build on an automatically-optimized, encrypted by default internet? What if it was all completely compatible with current internet protocols, paving the way for immediate adoption?

The dawn of the DeWeb movement is upon us. Right now, hundreds of teams, projects, and individuals are working to decentralize the internet at its core. Some are focused on content delivery and storage. Others are revolutionizing how we think of security and performance.

When large numbers of dedicated people work in unison, amazing things happen. It’s time we bring these parties together for a multi-week, hyper-focused effort to accelerate the world’s adoption of DeWeb technologies.

Introducing the 2021 DeWeb Hackathon, presented by [Syntropy](https://www.syntropynet.com/).

## Challenges

### Blockchain applications/integrations

Although blockchains are touted as decentralized software, many nodes in most of the blockchains run on the same cloud service providers like Amazon, Azure and others. In order to further decentralization, it is necessary to make the setup of a secure node infrastructure and interoperable blockchains as easy as possible.

- Node infrastructure (staking service)
  - Create a Staking-as-a-Service application that can automatically set up nodes for nominators via the Syntropy Network
- Interoperability
  - Setup automatically orchestrated infrastructure for blockchain nodes, including monitoring, alerting, etc.
- Tokenization/NFT
  - Create a protocol that uses NFTs as digital twins for physical infrastructure (managing, transferring infrastructure, etc.)
- Dapps
- Protocols
- Open-source contribution to Syntropy
- Expand our already [existing integrations](https://github.com/SyntropyNet/syntropy-blockchain-integrations) on our GitHub

### Gaming applications

The eSports scene is plagued with high ping and malicious attackers. To dwarf attacks and minimize latency, the Syntropy network can be used as an overlay between the players and the game servers. 

- Create an app for e-sport
  - Make a web application like [FaceIT](https://www.faceit.com/) that can organize competitive matches between two teams which would be played over the Syntropy network
- Create something for tournaments
  - Create an application that can automatically orchestrate tournament game servers and dispatch connection info to every participating player of the opposing teams
- Create something for server owner.
  - Create an application that automatically orchestrates Minecraft servers that communicate by the BungeeCord proxy over the Syntropy network
- Open-source contribution to Syntropy
- Expand our already existing Syntropy [gaming integrations](https://github.com/SyntropyNet/syntropy-gaming-integrations) on our GitHub

### IoT applications

As the number of IoT devices continues to grow at an exponential rate it is getting harder and harder to manage them easily and securely. The Syntropy Stack proposes an easy way to ensure stable and secure connectivity between IoT devices and their controllers without a hassle.

- Create something with Raspberry Pi
  - Design a Raspberry Pi image that would have the Syntropy Agent installed by default, controlled via the Cockpit service
- Smart-home
  - Create an application for zigbee with Syntropy Agent for communication between different applications
  - Create an application for an automated Smart Home system installation
  - Create a Zigbee/MQTT/etc. Proxy for communication between IoT devices over the Syntropy Network
- Make use of routers agent
  - Port the Syntropy Agent to OpenWRT or any other internet router distribution
- Geeky stuff
  - Create a Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi Syntropy gateway
- Open-source contribution to Syntropy
- Secure edge computing

### Software applications
There are many latency-critical applications like video streaming, video chatting, virtual private networks, etc. Show us how you would use the Syntropy Stack and its network in order to minimize latency and ensure the security of your users’ data.
- Secure network
- Next generation VPN
  - Create a white-label VPN that uses the Syntropy Stack for connection orchestration
- Bots
  - Create a Slack bot that can control your Syntropy Network (endpoint, connection management, status, etc.)
- Infrastructure automation
- Applications
- [Open-source contribution](https://github.com/SyntropyNet) to Syntropy
- Port the Syntropy Agent to platforms like FreeBSD

### DARP Data analysis
[DARP](https://darp.syntropystack.com/) is the decentralized autonomous routing protocol that Syntropy uses to understand and analyze the internet's pathways. DARP nodes constantly share latency information, creating a global intelligence layer for internet pathways. 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Apply data science techniques, such as machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence to find best routing paths over longer period of time
- Examine data from various angles to see hidden trends and/or opportunities
- Create visualisations

### UI/UX track
At Syntropy we put a great focus on making our applications look great and be user friendly. Show us how you imagine future iterations of Syntropy software. Create Mock-Ups / Wireframes / Designs.
- Make Syntropy Mobile Friendly
- Design Dashbards that would extend user experience and provide valueable information.
- Functionality extensions

## Judging
